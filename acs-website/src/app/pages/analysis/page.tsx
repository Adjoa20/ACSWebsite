              Environmental analysis is used by many managers of organizations to
              identify trends or outside forces that may impact upon the success or
              failure of an organization. Managers usually look at the strengths;
              weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) in the environment. They
              will also look at the political situation; economy, cultural forces,
              social conditions, competitors, technology and legal factors when
              analyzing the environment. In essence, environmental analysis helps
              managers understand what is happening in both internal and external of
              the organization. In the subsequent paragraphs, I have selected two
              main tools (SWOT and PESTLE) in an attempt to analyze American
              Cooperative School’s environment.

            employs teachers who are committed, have patient, and concerned about
            the development and welfare of students. Among these teachers, ACS has
            skillful individuals from overseas (Europe and United States of
            American) who work as volunteers. The volunteers bring with them a
            refine cultural that introduces the students to different culture in
            the globe. Their areas of concentration include teaching creativity
            art and music, and languages (English and French). All staffs are
            fluent with the English language and as a result, all students from
            Nursery to the Upper class speak and express themselves well with the
            language. American Cooperative School also employs a full-time time
            French teacher who teaches the upper primary and junior high levels.
            Students at these grade levels are able to express themselves casually
            with the French language. All subjects and teaching instructions
            excluding the local language are provided and taught in English
            language and sometimes French. Speaking of the English and French
            languages are compulsory in the school premises. These enforcements
            have shaped and brighten American Cooperative School students in oral
            communication and consequently make them standout among the other
            competitive schools.

            happy to see their children taking part in this program and event. The
            occasion is also used to raise funds to assist the school in its
            financial obligations. Because this program is focus on the birth of

            tremendous value to the reputation and quality of education American
            Cooperative School offers over its competitors. Other events and
            entertaining programs include Easter concert and end of school year

            entertaining programs, students are allowed to demonstrate their
            talents in all areas of their choice. These outreach entertaining
            programs have improved the social behavior of the students and as a

            Changes to the skills required to be a teacher. Public school teachers
            are mostly trained teachers from the government’s teacher training
            institutions. Majority of Private schools employs individuals who have
            completed Senior High Schools to teach the primary schools. At the
            moment the government is in the process of enforcing all Junior High
            School teachers to obtain Diploma in Education as a basic requirement.
            If the government enforces this in the private school, it will
            drastically affect the private schools. Most private schools cannot
            afford to pay trained teacher and as a result they may be forced to
            close down.

            to pay for their children to continue their education with four
            additional years of senior secondary education. There is a risk that
            government may take over all private schools and offer free education
            to those who pay fees for the same basic education offered by the
            government. All private schools offering basic education may run the
            risk of handing over their schools to the government.

            Private schools in Ghana are primarily financed through student fees
            and do not receive government subsidies, free buildings or free land.
            In addition to school fees some for-profit private schools are
            financed by fees, reinvested surpluses and small bank loans. In
            contrast, religious schools may be financed by fees, savings from

            at age four. This was implemented in September 2007, as part of the
            country&apos;s Education Reform Policy; the system is structured in a
            2-6-3-4 format. Students must attend two years of pre-primary

            of junior secondary education. As part of the Ghana government’s
            program called Free Compulsory Universal Basic Education (FCUBE),

              School becomes fully integrated, three years after opening the
              Junior High School, it will be the only private Junior High School
              in the town with grades 7-9. Given the fact that Public Schools do
              not charge students for tuition, it is important that American
              Cooperative School offers many attractive and excellent programs
              that exceed what are offered in those public and other private

              have a teacher to student ratio of 1:45. American Cooperative School
              students will receive more attention, and be in a better learning
              environment than the public and other private schools. Also, student
              to teacher relationships will be much stronger.

              Cooperative School’s excellent programs and structure, it will draw
              students from the private and public school system. The competition
